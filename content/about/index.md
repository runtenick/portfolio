I am a passionate computer scientist from Brazil, having spent my formative years in the vibrant city of Rio de Janeiro. At 18, I embarked on an exciting journey to France to pursue my higher education, embracing the challenges and opportunities of living in a new country and adapting to newfound responsibilities.

My decision to study computer science was driven by a deep-seated logical mindset and a desire to create. Unlike pure mathematics or physics, computer science captivates me because it blends logic with creativity, much like painting or music. This discipline allows me to craft unique solutions and continually improve my skills through practice.

At the end of my Bachelor's second year, I interned at CGI, a leading Canadian IT company, where I worked on-site at Michelinâ€™s headquarters. Over two months, I designed and initiated the development of a web application to assist factory operators, gaining valuable hands-on experience. This opportunity paved the way for an apprenticeship at CGI, allowing me to delve deeper into the application's development while balancing work and academics, during my 3rd year.

Now, as a fresh graduate, I am more motivated than ever to enhance my programming skills and apply them to real-world scenarios. I am eager to make a meaningful impact and continue my journey in the dynamic field of computer science.
