I am a passionate computer scientist from Brazil, having spent my formative years in the vibrant city of Rio de Janeiro. At 18, I embarked on an exciting journey to France to pursue my higher education, embracing the challenges and opportunities of living in a new country and adapting to newfound responsibilities.

My decision to study computer science was driven by a deep-seated logical mindset and a desire to create. Unlike pure mathematics or physics, computer science captivates me because it blends logic with creativity, much like painting or music. This discipline allows me to craft unique solutions and continually improve my skills through practice.
